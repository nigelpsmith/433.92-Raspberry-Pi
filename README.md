433.92-Raspberry-Pi
===================

This is the Windows CLI that can be used to control 433.92Mhz devices. It communicates with the 433-daemon.
Despite the three daemons are working pretty well, this is only a proof of concept because i'm not a Windows C programmer. 
If people want to rewrite it or start all over, feel free. The purpose of this program is just to show what the 433-daemon (and it's JSON api) is capable of.
